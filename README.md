## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology

### What I learned

While I was working through this project I learned to work with custom properties that is a great way to write some cool css code because is helpfully to edit faster something like colors, fonts, etc.

I also learned how to use BEM Methodology which helps to write a better structur to html and css.

```html
<!--BEM Methodology -->
<section class="services">
      <div class="services__image service__img--1"></div>
      <div class="services__texts">
        <h2 class="services__title">Transform your brand</h2>
        <p class="services__paragraph">We are a full-service creative agency specializing in helping brands grow fast. 
          Engage your clients through compelling visuals that do most of the marketing for you.
        </p>
        <a href="#" class="services__cta">Learn more</a>
      </div>

      <div class="services__image service__img--2"></div>
      <div class="services__texts services__texts--2">
        <h2 class="services__title">Stand out to the right audience</h2>
        <p class="services__paragraph">Using a collaborative formula of designers, researchers, photographers, videographers, and copywriters, weâ€™ll build and extend your brand in digital places. 
        </p>
        <a href="#" class="services__cta">Learn more</a>
      </div>
    </section>
```

```css
/*Custom Properties*/
:root {
  /* colores primarios */
  --soft-red: hsl(7, 99%, 70%);
  --yellow: hsl(51, 100%, 49%);
  --dark-desaturated-cyan: #25564b;

  /*Fuentes */
  --font1: 'Barlow', sans-serif;
  --font2: 'Fraunces', serif;
}
```
<!--
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
-->
